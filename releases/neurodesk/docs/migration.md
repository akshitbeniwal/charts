# Migration

This page is the consolidated **omit/keep** reference for moving both
deployments onto the `neurodesk` chart, plus a safe rollout plan. For the
how-to detail, see [consuming-from-neurocloud.md](consuming-from-neurocloud.md)
and [consuming-from-devstack.md](consuming-from-devstack.md). Upgrading an
existing release from chart 0.1.x is covered in [0.1.x -> 0.2.0](#01x---020),
from 0.2.x in [0.2.x -> 0.3.0](#02x---030), and moving the AIS umbrella chart
from its own JupyterHub to this chart in
[AIS umbrella chart 1.x -> 2.0](#ais-umbrella-chart-1x---20).

## The big picture

Both repos previously built the **same** JupyterHub + CVMFS + security stack by
hand — neurocloud as several ArgoCD apps, devstack as numbered scripts. This
chart factors that shared stack out once. After migration each repo:

- **omits** the pieces now provided by the chart, and
- **keeps** its infrastructure, secrets pipeline, and deployment-specific apps.

On an **existing** neurocloud cluster the chart first runs alongside the apps
that own SPO and CVMFS and reuses them; nothing is omitted until an ownership
transfer has been rehearsed (see below).

## neurocloud — two cases

neurocloud's `mounts` and `security` Argo CD apps own more than the notebook
layer: `mounts` owns the cluster-scoped CSIDriver `cvmfs.csi.cern.ch` and
StorageClass `cvmfs`; `security` owns the upstream SPO v1.0.0 install **and**
`charts/security` (neurocloud's AppArmor profile, the `neurocloud-spo-apparmor`
RBAC grant the operator needs, cryptnono and the DNS filter). So what the chart
replaces depends on the cluster:

| | (a) Fresh cluster (no `mounts`/`security` apps) | (b) Existing neurocloud cluster (adopt) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chart values | bundled defaults: `security.installOperator=true`, `cvmfs.enabled=true` | [`examples/neurocloud-values.yaml`](../examples/neurocloud-values.yaml): `security.installOperator=false`, `cvmfs.external=true`, profile name `neurodesk-notebook` |
| JupyterHub | the chart | the chart, in its **own** namespace / release / host, next to `charts/jupyter` |
| SPO operator, RBAC, CRDs | the chart | **kept** in the `security` app |
| CVMFS CSI driver + `cvmfs` StorageClass | the chart | **kept** in the `mounts` app |
| cryptnono, DNS filter | not in the chart | **kept** in the `security` app |

Both keep: ArgoCD (the app-of-apps engine); Longhorn → z2jh
`jupyterhub.hub.db.pvc.storageClassName` /
`jupyterhub.singleuser.storage.dynamic.storageClass` (hub DB + home PVCs) and
`global.storageClassName` for this chart's in-house PVCs; kube-prometheus-stack
→ `infra.monitoring.*`; `config/` + SOPS (secrets via `existingSecret`).

In (b) **no old app is removed**: pruning `security` or `mounts` would delete
the operator, RBAC and storage driver the chart reuses. Consolidating onto the
chart alone is a separate, **unrehearsed** ownership transfer — see step 6 of
the rollout plan. Details and the Argo CD `Application` are in
[consuming-from-neurocloud.md](consuming-from-neurocloud.md).

## ais-devstack — omit / keep

| Omit (now provided by the chart) | Keep (consumed by name or stays in repo) |
| --- | --- |
| JupyterHub install scripts (numbered steps `5` / `6` / `8` / `9`) | XNAT **server** + its plugins/jars |
| `cvmfs_mount` step | Longhorn (StorageClass) |
| squid script (→ `global.cvmfs.squidEnabled`) | **nfs-server** |
| security step (→ `security.*` + SPO) | Cleanup / teardown scripts |
| XNAT-upload notebook wiring (→ `xnat.enabled`) | The FUSE node-label step (still required) |

The omitted steps become **one** `helm install -f examples/devstack-values.yaml`
with `xnat.enabled=true`.

## What stays out of the chart entirely

Regardless of repo, these are **never** in the chart (infrastructure or
repo-specific policy):

- Longhorn, ArgoCD, the full Prometheus stack, nfs-server (infrastructure —
  consumed by name).
- cert-manager, unless you opt in with `cert-manager.enabled=true` on a cluster
  that has none (the bundled SPO needs it; both deployments already run it).
- The XNAT **server** and its server-side jars (stay in ais-devstack).
- cryptnono and the DNS filter (part of neurocloud's `security` app).
- Any secret material (lives in each repo's secrets pipeline).

## Rollout plan (per repo)

Do each repo on a branch, install alongside what runs today, and verify. For
neurocloud that means case (b) above; the final consolidation is a separate
plan (step 6).

1. **Branch.** Create a migration branch in the repo (neurocloud or devstack).
2. **Pin prerequisites.** Confirm the infra the chart needs is present:
   - a StorageClass — set hub DB / home PVCs on the z2jh keys
     `jupyterhub.hub.db.pvc.storageClassName` /
     `jupyterhub.singleuser.storage.dynamic.storageClass` (not
     `global.storageClassName`, which only covers this chart's own in-house PVCs),
     or rely on a cluster default,
   - notebook nodes the FUSE device plugin can run on (every untainted Linux
     node by default; no node label needed),
   - SPO handling — leave `security.installOperator=true` unless an SPO already
     runs (neurocloud: it does, in the `security` app). An existing SPO must be
     ≥ 1.0.0 to be reused (`installOperator=false`, with a profile name of its
     own); an older one (0.x, such as the neurodesk fork or devstack's
     `0.10.1-dev`) blocks the install — see [0.1.x -> 0.2.0](#01x---020),
   - CVMFS handling — leave `cvmfs.enabled=true` unless a CVMFS driver already
     runs (neurocloud: it does, in the `mounts` app); then use
     `cvmfs.external=true` and reuse it,
   - cert-manager, when `installOperator=true` (already running, or
     `cert-manager.enabled=true`),
   - Prometheus CRDs if you'll set `infra.monitoring.serviceMonitors=true`.
3. **Author the overlay.** Move auth/ingress/secrets and any deviations into the
   repo's overlay (`overlays/neurocloud-values.yaml` /
   `examples/devstack-values.yaml`). Keep secrets in SOPS/sealed-secrets, not in
   values. Remember the **subchart-boundary sync**: if you change
   `cvmfs.enabled` or `security.appArmor.profileName`, also edit the z2jh
   `jupyterhub.singleuser` block (see [architecture.md](architecture.md),
   [security.md](security.md), [cvmfs.md](cvmfs.md)).
4. **Install.**
   - neurocloud: add the ArgoCD `Application` for case (b) (pinned chart
     version, its own namespace and ingress host) and let it sync. The existing
     `charts/jupyter`, `mounts` and `security` apps keep running unchanged.
   - devstack: run the one `helm upgrade --install` in place of the numbered
     scripts, on a cluster where those scripts have not installed CVMFS or the
     old SPO (a cluster that already has the old SPO is refused — see
     [0.1.x -> 0.2.0](#01x---020)).
5. **Verify.**
   - `kubectl -n neurodesk get pods` — Hub and proxy healthy; plus cvmfs-csi,
     smarter-device-manager and (in `security-profiles-operator`) SPO when the
     chart installs them.
   - A test singleuser pod spawns, mounts `/cvmfs`, and the AppArmor profile is
     attached.
   - `cvmfs_mount_healthy` metric is present (if probe + monitoring on).
   - XNAT upload works from a notebook (if `xnat.enabled`).
6. **Consolidate (plan — not rehearsed).**
   - devstack: remove the numbered JH scripts + cvmfs_mount + squid + security
     + XNAT-upload wiring from the repo, so new devstack clusters use the chart.
   - neurocloud: retiring `charts/jupyter`, `mounts` and `security` requires an
     explicit **ownership transfer** of the SPO controller, its RBAC, the CRDs,
     the CVMFS storage-driver resources and the hub state to the chart
     **before** any old app is pruned. That procedure has not been rehearsed
     and is not published; until it is, stay on case (b) and do not delete or
     prune the old apps. cryptnono and the DNS filter live in the `security`
     app and need a home of their own before that app could ever go.
7. **Pin and merge.** Pin the chart version, update the repo's docs/runbook, and
   merge the branch.

Roll back by reverting the branch. In neurocloud case (b) nothing else changed,
so removing the new `Application` leaves the old apps as they were. Never run
two JupyterHub releases in the same namespace: z2jh's in-namespace names are
fixed.

## AIS umbrella chart 1.x -> 2.0

ais 2.0 (`releases/ais` in Australian-Imaging-Service/charts) installs its hub
through this chart instead of its own `jupyterhub` dependency (z2jh 4.3).

- Move the top-level `jupyterhub:` values block under `neurodesk.jupyterhub:`.
  ais 2.0 refuses to render while the old block exists, so an old
  `jupyterhub.enabled: false` cannot silently turn into a running hub. To
  install XNAT/CTP without a hub, set `neurodesk.enabled: false`.
- New prerequisites: Kubernetes >= 1.30, AppArmor on the nodes, cert-manager
  (or `neurodesk.cert-manager.enabled: true`), a single bundled Security
  Profiles Operator per cluster, and a `ReadWriteMany` StorageClass for XNAT's
  volumes, which now include `workspaces`.
- XNAT is wired to the hub by the umbrella; XNAT's own JupyterHub settings are
  still entered once in XNAT ([xnat.md](xnat.md#under-the-ais-umbrella)).
- **Before `helm upgrade`, apply the Security Profiles Operator CRDs.** Helm
  installs a chart's CRDs only on a first install, and this upgrade adds the
  operator to an existing release; the chart stops with this instruction if
  they are missing: `helm pull ais --untar` from the AIS repo, then
  `kubectl apply --server-side -f ais/charts/neurodesk/vendor/security-profiles-operator/crds/crds.yaml`.
- **The hub is no longer exposed by default.** ais 1.x left z2jh's defaults, so
  `<release>-jupyterhub-proxy-public` was a LoadBalancer. ais 2.0 has a
  ClusterIP `proxy-public` and no ingress: set `neurodesk.jupyterhub.ingress`
  (or `neurodesk.jupyterhub.proxy.service.type`) for the public URL users and
  XNAT need. Set a real login first (`neurodesk.auth.aaf`, or another
  authenticator): the default is z2jh's placeholder `dummy`, which accepts any
  username and password.
- The upgrade restarts XNAT (two plugins and the `workspaces` volume are added).
  The new PVC `<release>-xnat-web-workspaces` asks the default StorageClass for
  ReadWriteMany; if it cannot provide that, set
  `xnat.xnat-web.volumes.workspaces.storageClass` or `existingClaim`, or XNAT
  stays down waiting for it.
- `helm uninstall` now runs a cleanup Job first and refuses while any notebook
  server is running (see [install.md](install.md)).

**An existing ais 1.x hub: keep its names, or plan for losing its database.**
ais 1.x named its hub objects `<release>-jupyterhub-*` (it set
`jupyterhub.fullnameOverride: null`). This chart's default names are `hub`,
`proxy-public` and so on. With the default names, the upgrade removes the old
objects from the release, including the hub database PVC
`<release>-jupyterhub-hub-db-dir` (it has no keep policy); whether its data
survives then depends on the PersistentVolume's reclaim policy. So either:

1. **Keep the names** (for a hub that has users): set
   `neurodesk.jupyterhub.fullnameOverride: null`. The hub, its database PVC and
   its Secret keep their 1.x names. XNAT then uses
   `http://<release>-jupyterhub-hub:8081/hub/api`, and the `xnat` token is in
   Secret `<release>-jupyterhub-hub`.
2. **Start a fresh hub**: back up the old database PVC first. Users, API tokens
   and server records of the 1.x hub are not carried over.

User home PVCs are created by KubeSpawner, not Helm, so neither route deletes
them. Neither route has been rehearsed on a real ais 1.x release.

## 0.2.x -> 0.3.0

New, all off by default: servers launched from XNAT (`xnat.jupyterhub.*`), the
AAF login preset (`auth.aaf.*`), and the hub-side wiring for the AIS umbrella
chart. See [xnat.md](xnat.md).

### One home per user

The default `jupyterhub.singleuser.storage.dynamic.pvcNameTemplate` is now
`claim-{username}` (z2jh's is `claim-{user_server}`). ais-devstack runs XNAT
launches the same way (`jupyter-{username}`).

- Default servers keep their PVC: the name is the same for them.
- New named servers use the user's default home.
- Named servers that already exist (running or stopped) keep the per-server PVC
  KubeSpawner remembered for them (`claim-<user>--<server>`) until they are
  removed, and KubeSpawner no longer deletes such a PVC when its server is
  removed. Retire one only after its server is gone: check the user's servers
  (`GET /hub/api/users/<user>?include_stopped_servers=true`, or the admin page),
  copy what is needed, then delete the PVC.

**Do not switch an install that has used the shared home back to
`claim-{user_server}` while KubeSpawner may delete PVCs.** A named server
created while the home was shared remembers `claim-<user>`, and KubeSpawner
decides whether to delete by the *current* template: removing that server
would delete the user's shared home, the one their other servers use. Set
`jupyterhub.hub.config.KubeSpawner.delete_pvc: false` before switching, and keep
it until no such named server is left. `ci/test_home_pvc_policy.py` pins this
behaviour against KubeSpawner 7.1.0. On a fresh install, set a per-server
template before any server starts, if you want one; XNAT-launched servers then
lose their home when XNAT removes them.

### Hub reload on upgrade

The hub reads the integration settings and the chart's hub Python only when it
starts. A post-upgrade hook Job (`<fullname>-hub-reload`, allowed only `get`
and `patch` on the hub Deployment) stamps their fingerprint on the hub's pod
template, which restarts the hub when they changed and does nothing otherwise.
The first upgrade that runs it restarts the hub once.

### Other changes

- `xnat.server.host` may now be empty (`<release>-xnat-web`). The singleuser
  NetworkPolicy `singleuser-egress-xnat` now also renders for XNAT in the same
  namespace (then only XNAT's pods, `xnat.server.podLabels`/`port`), and it is
  no longer rendered when z2jh's singleuser NetworkPolicy is off (alone it
  limited notebook egress to DNS and XNAT).

## 0.1.x -> 0.2.0

Chart 0.2.0 replaces the bundled Security Profiles Operator. Read this before
running `helm upgrade` on a 0.1.x release.

### Breaking changes

1. **SPO: the neurodesk fork (`0.10.1-dev`) is gone.** The chart bundles
   upstream kubernetes-sigs SPO **1.0.0**, vendored with local patches
   (`vendor/security-profiles-operator/PROVENANCE.txt`). It is still bundled
   and on by default.
   - The operator now **always runs in namespace `security-profiles-operator`**
     (upstream 1.0.0 hard-codes it); in 0.1.x it ran in the release namespace.
     The release creates that namespace and keeps it on uninstall.
   - The profiles now use API `security-profiles-operator.x-k8s.io/v1` (the
     fork served `v1alpha1` AppArmorProfile and `v1beta1` SeccompProfile). They
     were already cluster-scoped under the fork; 0.2.0 only stops emitting a
     namespace on them. Their names are cluster-unique.
2. **cert-manager is required** when `security.installOperator=true`: already
   running in the cluster, or installed by the release with the new optional
   `cert-manager.enabled=true` (default `false`). 0.1.x docs said cert-manager
   was not needed; that is no longer true.
3. **External SPO (`installOperator=false`) must be ≥ 1.0.0.** SPO 0.x,
   including the neurodesk fork and AIS devstack's `0.10.1-dev`, is not
   compatible.
4. **The AppArmor profile is structured-only.** The fork's
   `spec.abstract.extra` raw rules do not exist upstream; the crypto-miner exec
   denylist that used them is dropped (see
   [security.md](security.md#what-the-apparmor-profile-allows) for what the
   profile allows and the suggested runtime-detection replacement).
5. **Notebook users: debuggers and tracers are blocked.** The 0.2.0 AppArmor
   profile does not allow ptrace between notebook processes; the fork profile
   did (`ptrace peer=notebook,`, another raw rule). `gdb` cannot run programs
   (`ptrace: Permission denied`), `PTRACE_TRACEME` / `PTRACE_ATTACH` fail with
   `EACCES`, and `strace`, `ltrace` or `py-spy` would fail the same way. SPO's
   structured API has no ptrace field; neurocloud runs this same profile. See
   [security.md](security.md#what-the-apparmor-profile-allows).
6. **Seccomp attach path** is `operator/<profileName>.json`. The 0.1.x docs
   gave `operator/<namespace>/<profileName>.json`, which does not fit a
   cluster-scoped profile; if you added a `seccompProfile` block to your
   overlay, check its path.
7. **Profiles always render when enabled.** `security.assumeCrdsPresent` now
   only skips the API discovery check for offline renders, and
   `validation.apparmorNoCrdProvider` has no effect.
8. **New render guards** (`templates/validate.yaml`): legacy-SPO detection,
   external-SPO API check, cert-manager check (`validation.certManagerMissing`),
   and values carried over from 0.1.x by `helm upgrade --reuse-values` (see
   below). An offline `helm template` with default values now fails until you
   assert cert-manager (`--api-versions cert-manager.io/v1/Certificate`) or set
   `cert-manager.enabled=true`.
9. **`xnat.uploadExtension.installerImage` was removed** and now fails the
   render. It never reached a manifest; set
   `jupyterhub.hub.extraEnv.XNAT_EXT_INSTALLER_IMAGE` instead.
10. **Bug fix — hub DB PVC StorageClass.** In 0.1.x the default
    `jupyterhub.hub.db.pvc.storageClassName: ""` rendered as an explicit empty
    class ("no StorageClass"), so on clusters relying on a default
    StorageClass the `hub-db-dir` PVC never bound and the Hub stayed
    `Pending`. 0.2.0 leaves the key unset (=> cluster default); fresh installs
    are unaffected. **A release upgraded in place** whose `hub-db-dir` PVC was
    created with that `""` must keep
    `jupyterhub.hub.db.pvc.storageClassName: ""` in its overlay for the
    upgrade: otherwise Helm's three-way merge tries to remove the field, and
    Kubernetes rejects changing a PVC's `storageClassName`. The alternative is
    to back up the hub state and recreate the PVC.
11. **`helm uninstall` runs a pre-delete cleanup hook** (`uninstallCleanup`,
    default on). It removes the profiles, the CVMFS probe and PVCs and the
    operator's runtime objects while their controllers still run, so the
    uninstall no longer hangs or strands them. It **refuses while any user
    server exists in the release namespace**: stop every server first, or the
    uninstall stops (before deleting anything) with the release in status
    `uninstalling`; either stop the servers and re-run the uninstall, or keep
    the release with `helm rollback <release> <revision marked uninstalling>`.
    **Pipelines that apply `helm template` output with `kubectl` must now add
    `--no-hooks`**, or the cleanup Job runs at install time. See
    [install.md](install.md#teardown--uninstall).
12. **The FUSE device plugin runs on every Linux node.** smarter-device-manager
    now defaults to `nodeSelector: {kubernetes.io/os: linux}`, so the
    `smarter-device-manager=enabled` node label is no longer needed, and the
    plugin now also runs on **unlabelled** Linux nodes. To keep the old
    behaviour, set `smarter-device-manager.nodeSelector:
    {smarter-device-manager: enabled}` in your overlay (Helm merges it with the
    default, so a node must be Linux and labelled).
13. **Bug fix — Squid refused pods outside k3s.** `cvmfs.squid.clientCidrs`
    defaulted to the k3s ranges (`10.42.0.0/16`, `10.43.0.0/16`), so on k0s or
    kubeadm clusters, for example, Squid answered `403` and CVMFS silently fell
    back to `DIRECT`, uncached. The default is now all private ranges
    (`10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`); Squid is ClusterIP-only.
    If you set your own `clientCidrs`, make sure they cover your pod network.
14. **z2jh 4.4.2** (was `~4.3.0`): removing a *named* server now also deletes
    its home PVC — see [xnat.md](xnat.md). The singleuser image moved to
    `ghcr.io/neurodesk/neurodesktop` (digest-pinned), and the Hub defaults
    changed (`consecutiveFailureLimit: 0`, `KubeSpawner.http_timeout: 120`,
    `singleuser.startTimeout: 600`). See [values.md](values.md).

### Which releases can upgrade in place

| 0.1.x release used | Upgrade |
| --- | --- |
| External SPO **≥ 1.0.0** (`installOperator=false`) | **In place.** Check the seccomp path (6 above), that the profile names are unique on the cluster, and keep `hub.db.pvc.storageClassName: ""` if the hub PVC was created with it (10 above). |
| External SPO **0.x** (`installOperator=false`) | Upgrade that SPO to ≥ 1.0.0 **first**; the chart refuses to render until the cluster serves the SPO `v1` API. Then upgrade the chart in place, as in the row above. |
| The **bundled** fork (`installOperator=true`, the 0.1.x default) | **Not in place.** See below. |

**Upgrade with your own values files, never `--reuse-values`.** Run
`helm upgrade … -f my-values.yaml` (or `--reset-then-reuse-values`). Across
0.1.x -> 0.2.0, `--reuse-values` renders the new templates with the old
release's values: the old notebook image, the old SPO fork image, the removed
`installerImage` key. The chart refuses that case with a message.

### A fresh 0.2.0 install on a cluster that ran 0.1.x

Uninstalling a 0.1.x release that bundled the fork leaves the fork's CRDs
behind (Helm never deletes `crds/`). They serve only the legacy API, so a
**fresh** 0.2.0 install on that cluster is refused (guard 5a). If **no other
SPO user** remains on the cluster, remove them with the CRD step of the full
SPO teardown in [install.md](install.md#3-what-remains-after-a-clean-uninstall-by-design):
deleting the CRDs deletes every profile of those kinds cluster-wide. If
anything else still uses SPO, do not delete them.

### Releases that bundled the fork: planned maintenance

A 0.1.x release that bundled the fork **cannot be upgraded in place**. Helm
never upgrades `crds/`, so the old CRDs would stay, the `v1` profile would not
apply, and the operator would move to another namespace. Guard 5a detects the
legacy API and stops `helm upgrade` **before Helm changes anything**, so an
attempted upgrade leaves the running release untouched.

Moving such a release to 0.2.0 is **planned maintenance**. The procedure is
**pending a dedicated rehearsal** and is not published yet. **Do not
improvise it**: stay on 0.1.x until the rehearsed procedure is available.
